        used with a role name in the path, the token will be created against the
        specified role name; this may override options set during this call.


        :param id: The ID of the client token. Can only be specified by a root token.
            The ID provided may not contain a `.` character. Otherwise, the

            This maximum token TTL cannot be changed later, and unlike with normal tokens, updates to the system/mount
            max TTL value will have no effect at renewal time -- the token will never be able to be renewed or used past

            limit to the number of uses.

            no maximum TTL (unless an "explicit-max-ttl" is also set) but every renewal
